# Axis Infinitum Survival Command Center

This project provides a minimal example of a configuration UI inspired by the prior discussion.
It does **not** implement real arbitrage or bug bounty features.

To use it, open `index.html` in a browser and fill in your credentials or routing information.
No data is sent anywhere, so further integration is required for a functional system.

## Files
- `index.html`: Basic HTML/JS page with forms for API keys and payout routing numbers.
- `README.md`: Default repo README.

## Disclaimer
This project is a demonstration only. It stores input locally in your browser and
contains no real trading or exploit code.
